What, how and why?
• What is the purpose of the requirements
activity?



Explore the problem space
Establish a description of what will be developed

• How to capture requirements once
discovered




In prototypes or operational product
Through structured or rigorous notations
Different capturing mechanisms emphasize and deemphasize different aspects

Why bother?

Requirements activity is the stage where
miscommunication occurs most commonly

What are requirements?
• A statement about an intended product that specifies
what it is expected to do or how it will perform
• Different forms and different levels of abstraction
• User stories (most prevalent in agile development
contexts)
• Format:
As a <role>, I want <behavior> so that <benefit>

• Example user stories for a travel organizer might be:
As a <traveler>, I want <to save my favorite airline for all my flights>
so that <I will be able to collect air miles>
As a <travel agent>, I want <my special discount rates to be displayed to
me> so that <I can offer my clients competitive rates>

Different kinds of requirements
• Functional:
 What the system should do

• Data:
 What kinds of data need to be stored?
 How will they be stored (for example,
database)?

Different kinds of requirements
Environment or context of use:
Physical: dusty? noisy? vibration? light? heat? humidity?
…. (for example, in a hospital)
Social: collaboration and co-ordination, data sharing,
distributed, synchronous or asynchronous, privacy
Organizational: user support, communications structure
and infrastructure, availability of training
Technical: On what technologies will it run or need to be
compatible?

Different kinds of requirements
Users — Who are they?
• Characteristics: nationality, educational background,
attitude to computers
• System use: novice, expert, casual, frequent
Novice: prompted, constrained, clear
Expert: flexibility, access/power
Frequent: shortcuts
Casual/infrequent: clear menu paths
• User profile

www.id-book.com

11

Different kinds of requirements
• Usability goals
• User experience goals
• Different products have different
requirements and may be implemented in
different ways, for example,
trustworthiness

www.id-book.com

12

Usable security
How to make security robust without
detracting from user experience
• If the usability of security is ignored, then
security mechanisms will be circumvented
• Passwords as an example
 Too much advice about how to choose a
password
 Coping strategies may compromise security

Data gathering for requirements
• Interviews, observation, and questionnaires
• Studying documentation:

 Procedures and rules are often written down in manuals
 Good source of data about the steps involved in an activity
and any regulations governing a task
 Not to be used in isolation
 Good for understanding legislation and getting background
information
 No stakeholder time, which is a limiting factor for other
techniques

• Researching similar products:
 Good for prompting requirements

Combining data gathering
Direct observation,
indirect observation,
interviews, diaries,
and surveys

17

Combining data gathering
• Diaries and interviews: multiple information
devices
• Interviews, think aloud evaluation, questionnaire,
evaluation of working prototype: memory aid for
traumatic brain injury
• Studying documentation, evaluating other

systems, user observation, and group interviews:
ship’s maneuvering system

• Ethnographic study, interviews, usability tests,
and user participation: tabletop user interface for
genomic data

18

Using probes to engage with users
• Many types of probe:
 Designed to prompt users into action
 For researchers to learn about users

• Cultural probe:
 Wallet containing postcards, maps, camera, photo album, and diary
 Participants asked to answer questions using wallet contents

• Design probe:
 Form relates specifically to particular question and context, for example, Top
Trumps probe

Using probes to engage with users
• Technology probe:
 Toolkits, mobile phone apps, sensor-based monitoring, for
example, M-Kulinda to alert participants about unexpected
movement at home.

• Provocative probe:
 Technology probe designed to challenge norms and attitudes, for
example, the Box to challenge domestic laundry practices

Contextual Inquiry
• Part of Contextual Design, but also used on its own to gather
requirements
• One-on-one field interviews (contextual interviews)
 1.5 to 2 hours long
 Focus on daily life at home or work relevant to the project
 Uses a model of master (participant) and apprentice (researcher)

• Four main principles:
Context: Going to the user, wherever they are, and seeing what they
do as they do it
Partnership: User and interviewer explore user’s life together
Interpretation: Observations interpreted by user and interviewer
together
Focus: Project focus to understand to what should be paid attention
www.id-book.com

21

Contextual Inquiry
•

Interview guided by “cool concepts” divided into two groups

•

Joy of life concepts:
 How products make our lives richer and more fulfilling
 Accomplish, connection, identity, and sensation

•

Joy of use concepts:
 Describe impact of using the product
 Direct in action, the hassle factor, and the learning delta

•

Interview in four parts
 Overview, transition, main interview, and wrap-up

• Following interview, interpretation session
 Contextual design models are created or consolidated
 Most relevant models are chosen by team, out of 10 suggested
www.id-book.com

22

Brainstorming for innovation
• Include participants from a wide range of
disciplines, with a broad range of experience
• Don't ban silly stuff
• Use catalysts for further inspiration
• Keep records. Capture every idea, without
censoring
• Sharpen the focus
• Use warm-up exercises and make the session
fun
www.id-book.com

23

Bringing requirements to life
• Augmenting the basic requirements
expressed as stories, in Volere template, or
in other form
• Personas
 Rich descriptions of typical users, not specific
people

• Scenarios
 An informal narrative story, simple, ‘natural’,
personal, and not generalizable
www.id-book.com

24

Personas
• Capture a set of user characteristics (user profile)
• Synthesized from real people based on user
research
• Typical, not idealized
• Bring to life with name, characteristics, goals, and
personal background
 Relevant to product under development

• Good persona helps designer with design
decisions and reminds team about who will use
the product
• Develop a small set of personas with one primary

Scenario for group travel organizer
“The Thomson family enjoy outdoor activities and want to try their hand at sailing
this year. There are four family members: Sky (8 years old), Eamonn (12 years old),
Claire (32), and Will (35). One evening after dinner they decide to start exploring the
possibilities. They want to discuss the options together but Claire has to visit her
elderly mother so will be joining the conversation from her mother’s house down the
road. As a starting point, Will enters an idea they had been discussing over dinner – a
sailing trip for four novices in the Mediterranean. The system supports users to log on
from different locations and use different devices so that all members of the family
can interact easily and comfortably with it wherever they are. The system's initial
suggestion is a flotilla, where several crews (with various levels of experience) sail
together on separate boats. Sky and Eamonn aren't very happy at the idea of going on
vacation with a group of other people, even though the Thomson’s would have their
own boat. The travel organizer shows them descriptions of flotillas from other
children their ages and they are all very positive, so eventually, everyone agrees to
explore flotilla opportunities. Will confirms this recommendation and asks for
detailed options. As it's getting late, he asks for the details to be saved so everyone
can consider them tomorrow. The travel organizer emails them a summary of the
different options available.”

Design fiction
• Communicate a vision with future technologies
• Fictional world in which ethics, emotions, and
context can be explored without concrete
constraints
• Examples:
 Privacy and surveillance
 Exploring ethics

• Scenarios are about “overcoming the
monster,” while design fiction is about “quest”

31

Use cases
• Focus on functional requirements and capture
interaction
• Can be used in design or to capture
requirements
• Use cases are step-by-step descriptions of
interactions
• Two styles:
 Essential use cases: division of tasks, no
implementation detail
 Use case with normal and alternative courses: more
detail

Summary
• A requirement is a statement about an intended product that
specifies what it is expected to do or how it will perform.
• Articulating requirements avoids miscommunication and
supports technical developers and users to contribute.
• Different kinds of requirements: functional, data, environmental
(context of use), user characteristics, usability goals, and user
experience goals.
• Requirements data gathering uses: questionnaires, interviews,
observation, studying documentation, and similar products
• Scenarios are a story-based narrative to explore existing
behavior, potential of new products, and futuristic visions of use.
• Personas capture characteristics of typical users that are
relevant to the product under development.
• Scenarios and personas together bring requirements to life.
• Use cases capture details about an existing or imagined
interaction between users and the product.
